# Configuring MSDTC for Epicor iScala Components

This script is designed to configure the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) settings for Epicor iScala components. The script sets specific values for transaction timeouts and concurrent application pool sizes to optimize the performance and reliability of Epicor iScala within the Distributed COM (DCOM) architecture.

## About Epicor iScala

Epicor iScala is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software suite designed for businesses to manage various aspects of their operations, including finance, inventory, production, and more.

## COM (Component Object Model) and DCOM (Distributed COM)

COM is a Microsoft technology that enables software components to communicate and interact with each other within a Windows environment. DCOM extends this concept to distributed systems, allowing components to communicate across network boundaries.

## Application Pools

In the context of this script, "application pools" refer to the groups of components and services managed by Epicor iScala. These pools handle various tasks within the ERP system.
